# 🎯 Technology Sprint Development Model - FoxBox Framework

## Development Phases Overview

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Main Goals | Completion Criteria |
|-------|------|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | 🔁 **Proof of Concept** | Demonstrate that the core idea works in practice | • Technical implementation minimum ("it boots")<br>• 1-2 example functions<br>• Demonstration for limited audience | ✅ Implementation works live on at least one main execution path without manual intervention |
| 2 | 🛠️ **Minimum Viable Product** | Build core features that meet minimum requirements | • MVP backlog ready<br>• 80/20 features implemented<br>• Testable API or user interface | ✅ First user testing completed and feedback collected |
| 3 | ⚡ **Enhanced MVP** | Improve product based on user feedback and data analysis | • UI and functionality improvements<br>• Polished user experience and performance<br>• Claude/LLM agent integration | ✅ User NPS ≥ 8<br>✅ Validation from at least 5 users |
| 4 | 🚀 **Market-Ready Product** **← CURRENT** | Product is at sales and deployment readiness level | • Complete production structure (README.md, installation, agent protocols)<br>• Paid pilot or deployment readiness for customer environment<br>• Scalable deployment (e.g., Scaleway/Docker) | ✅ Customer/investor accepts and pays for product test or license |
| 5 | 📈 **Scalable Product** | Scale system for product markets with automation and data collection ready | • Telco/Infra/LLM backends in production (Scaleway, MetaTrader, PostgreSQL, Kafka)<br>• Sales channels activated (web, tiers, API)<br>• Development metrics automated (CI/CD, telemetry) | ✅ Product operates 24/7 in scaled environment for at least 30 days without regression |

## Current Status: Phase 4 - Market-Ready Product 🚀

### Key Focus Areas:
- Complete production documentation and deployment guides
- Finalize agent communication protocols
- Prepare customer-ready deployment infrastructure
- Validate pricing and licensing models

### Next Steps:
1. Finalize README.md with comprehensive installation instructions
2. Complete agent protocol documentation
3. Set up Scaleway/Docker deployment pipeline
4. Prepare customer pilot program materials
5. Conduct final security and performance audits
