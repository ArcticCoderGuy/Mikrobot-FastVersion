## üìà Trading Strategy Overview

### The MIKROBOT Method

MIKROBOT FASTVERSION uses a systematic 4-phase approach to identify and execute high-probability trades:

#### Phase 1: M5 Structure Break Detection
- **What it does:** Monitors M5 timeframe for structure breaks
- **Your role:** None - fully automated
- **Indicator:** System status shows "Monitoring M5 BOS"

#### Phase 2: M1 Break Identification  
- **What it does:** Detects first M1 break after M5 confirmation
- **Your role:** None - system records break candle automatically
- **Indicator:** System status shows "M1 Break Detected"

#### Phase 3: M1 Retest Validation
- **What it does:** Waits for and validates price retest of break level
- **Your role:** None - automated quality assessment
- **Indicator:** System status shows "Retest Confirmed"

#### Phase 4: 0.6 Ylipip Entry Trigger
- **What it does:** Calculates precise entry point and executes trade
- **Your role:** None - automatic trade execution
- **Indicator:** You'll see trade appear in MT5 terminal

### Understanding the 0.6 Ylipip Trigger

The ylipip trigger is a sophisticated calculation that determines the exact entry point:

- **"Ylipip"** = Advanced pip calculation that works across all asset types
- **"0.6"** = The precise threshold that triggers trade execution
- **Universal** = Same 0.6 value works for Forex, Indices, Metals, Crypto, etc.

**Example:**
```
EURUSD M1 Break at 1.1000
Ylipip calculation: 1.1000 + (0.6 √ó pip value) = 1.1006
Entry trigger: When price reaches 1.1006
```

## üéñÔ∏è XPWS System Operation

### What is XPWS?

**XPWS (Extra-Profit-Weekly-Strategy)** is an intelligent profit enhancement system that automatically activates when you achieve 10% weekly profit on any trading pair.

### How XPWS Works

#### Normal Operation (Standard Mode)
- **Risk-Reward:** 1:1 ratio
- **Trade Management:** Standard take-profit at 1:1
- **Weekly Tracking:** System monitors profit per symbol

#### XPWS Activation (Enhanced Mode)
- **Trigger:** 10% weekly profit achieved on any pair
- **Risk-Reward:** Switches to 1:2 ratio
- **Trade Management:** Move to breakeven at 1:1, continue to 1:2
- **Duration:** Remainder of the week
- **Reset:** Every Monday at market open

### XPWS Example Scenario

**Week Start (Monday):**
- EURUSD trades with 1:1 take-profit
- System tracks weekly performance

**Wednesday - 10% Weekly Profit Achieved:**
- XPWS automatically activates for EURUSD
- New EURUSD trades now target 1:2 risk-reward
- Other pairs remain in standard mode

**Trade Management in XPWS Mode:**
1. Trade enters at 1.1000, SL at 1.0990 (10 pip risk)
2. At 1.1010 (1:1 profit): Stop-loss moves to breakeven (1.1000)
3. Target remains at 1.1020 (1:2 profit)
4. Risk eliminated, only profit potential remains

**Benefits:**
- **No Additional Risk:** Once 1:1 is reached, trade is risk-free
- **Enhanced Profits:** Double the profit potential
- **Automatic Management:** No manual intervention required
