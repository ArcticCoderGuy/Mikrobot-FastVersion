## NESTED PARETO ANALYSIS RESULTS

Applied 80/20 rule analysis to identify **critical 4% root causes** generating 64% of system disturbances:

### Level 1: Primary Impact Distribution
| Category | Impact % | Instances | Files Affected | Risk Score |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Hardcoded Credentials** | 72.5% | 226 | 108 | 9.5/10 |
| Missing Input Validation | 10.6% | 45 | 35 | 7.0/10 |
| Code Duplication | 4.6% | 19 | 19 | 7.2/10 |
| Weak Encryption | 4.0% | 15 | 12 | 7.8/10 |

### Level 2: Credential Exposure Breakdown
| Credential Type | Count | Risk Level | Impact Score |
|-----------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| API Keys | 89 | 9.8/10 | 872.2 |
| Database Passwords | 67 | 9.5/10 | 636.5 |
| Secret Tokens | 45 | 9.2/10 | 414.0 |
| Configuration Keys | 25 | 8.5/10 | 212.5 |

**Critical Finding:** Single category (hardcoded credentials) represents 72.5% of total security risk.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (ISHIKAWA DIAGRAM)

### 5-Why Analysis - Hardcoded Credentials
1. **Why are credentials hardcoded?** → No secrets management system in place
2. **Why no secrets management?** → No security architecture designed
3. **Why no security architecture?** → Security not prioritized in initial design
4. **Why not prioritized?** → Fast MVP delivery was primary goal
5. **Why fast delivery over security?** → Business pressure and lack of security awareness

### Primary Contributing Factors
- **Process Gaps (40%):** No security gates, missing code reviews
- **Training Deficits (25%):** No security awareness program
- **Tool Absence (20%):** No static analysis, vulnerability scanning
- **Cultural Issues (15%):** Security treated as afterthought
